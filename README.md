Trivia Game
Technologies used- HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY
Approach- First I used HTML to have a basic layout of how I wanted to place my trivia box, questions, answers, etc.  Then I styled it under CSS in which I was told that its best to do javascript first then style, which I understand now.  Then I worked on javascript after.
Installation Instructions- You can fork this repo and clone it to your repo!
5 user stories- User can click the start button to begin the game. User can click on an answer to a question to determine if his/her question is correct(Correct/Incorrect will show up under the answers) User will be able to grab a hint to each question by pushing the hint button.  User will be able to click next to move on to the next question.  User will be able to play music by pushing the play button on the media player.
